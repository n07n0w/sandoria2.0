# Rendering Issues Fixed - Summary

## 🐛 Problem Identified

The website was not rendering properly - only the header was visible while the main content was hidden. The issue was caused by **Framer Motion hydration problems** in Next.js 15, compounded by **recursive component calls** that caused infinite loops.

### Root Cause
- Elements were stuck in their initial animation state (`opacity: 0, y: 30`)
- Framer Motion animations weren't working due to server-side rendering (SSR) and client-side hydration mismatch
- **Critical Bug**: AnimatedComponent was calling itself recursively, causing infinite loops
- This is a common issue with Framer Motion in Next.js 15

## ✅ Solution Implemented

### 1. Client-Side Hydration Fix
Added proper client-side hydration handling to all pages with animations:

```typescript
const [isClient, setIsClient] = useState(false)

useEffect(() => {
  setIsClient(true)
}, [])

  // Fallback component for server-side rendering
  const AnimatedComponent = ({ children, ...props }: { children: React.ReactNode; [key: string]: unknown }) => {
    if (!isClient) {
      return <div style={{ opacity: 1, transform: 'translateY(0)' }}>{children}</div>
    }
    return <motion.div {...props}>{children}</motion.div>  // Fixed: was calling AnimatedComponent recursively
  }
```

### 2. Pages Fixed
- ✅ `src/app/page.tsx` - Home page
- ✅ `src/app/webinars/page.tsx` - Webinars page  
- ✅ `src/app/intensive/page.tsx` - Intensive page
- ✅ `src/app/about/page.tsx` - About page
- ✅ `src/app/contact/page.tsx` - Contact page
- ✅ `src/app/privacy/page.tsx` - Privacy page
- ✅ `src/app/sandbox/page.tsx` - Sandbox page

### 3. TypeScript Improvements
- Fixed `any` type usage with proper TypeScript types
- Removed unused imports
- All linting errors resolved

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Before Fix
```html
<!-- Elements were hidden -->
<h1 style="opacity:0;transform:translateY(30px)">Sandoria</h1>
```

### After Fix
```html
<!-- Elements are visible and animated -->
<h1 style="opacity:1;transform:translateY(0)">Sandoria</h1>
```

### How It Works
1. **Server-Side**: Elements render with `opacity: 1` (visible)
2. **Client-Side**: After hydration, Framer Motion takes over and provides smooth animations
3. **Fallback**: If JavaScript is disabled, content remains visible

## 🧪 Testing Results

- ✅ **Build**: `npm run build` - Successful
- ✅ **Linting**: `npm run lint` - No errors
- ✅ **Type Checking**: `npm run type-check` - Passed
- ✅ **Rendering**: Content now visible and properly animated
- ✅ **Production Ready**: All pages work correctly

## 🚀 Benefits

1. **Better UX**: Content is immediately visible, no more blank sections
2. **SEO Friendly**: Content renders on server-side
3. **Progressive Enhancement**: Works with or without JavaScript
4. **Smooth Animations**: Framer Motion works properly after hydration
5. **Type Safety**: Proper TypeScript types throughout
